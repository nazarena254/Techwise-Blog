## Behavior Driven Development
 Given the user and tutors opens the website he/she can see random tech tutors profile.<br>
 When the users enters correct email, they will get notifications whenever a new tech tutor profile is posted.<br>
 when the tech tutors sign up and login in correctly they will be able to create, update their profile from the web application and post it<br>
 Then the tutor will need to click logout on their profile dropdown menu and log out.
